# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator


## Project Description:
The task for this challenge was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Then, user is prompted with questions about their desired README.md.

After the user answers each question, a generatedREADME.md file is created based on user input.
